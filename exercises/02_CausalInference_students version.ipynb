    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "The following exercise is based on a (real-world) example by Allen Downey to demonstrate Simpson's Paradox.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2021, a journalist (The Atlantic magazine identified him as \"The Pandemic's Wrongest Man\") wrote a series of misleading articles about the COVID pandemic. In November, this journalist posted an online newsletter with the title \"Vaccinated English adults under 60 are dying at twice the rate of unvaccinated people the same age\". It includes a graph showing that the overall death rate among young, vaccinated people increased between April and September, 2021, and was actually higher among the vaccinated than among the unvaccinated.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might expect, this newsletter got a lot of attention. Among skeptics, it seemed like proof that vaccines were not just ineffective, but harmful. And among people who were counting on vaccines to end the pandemic, it seemed like a devastating setback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people fact-checked the article, and at first the results held up to scrutiny: the graph accurately represented data published by the U.K. Office for National Statistics. Specifically, it showed death rates, from any cause, for people in England between 10 and 59 years old, from March to September 2021. And between April and September, these rates were higher among the fully vaccinated, compared to the unvaccinated, by a factor of almost 2. So the journalist's description of the results was correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, his conclusion that vaccines were causing increased mortality was completely wrong. In fact, the data he reported shows that vaccines were safe and effective in this population, and demonstrably saved many lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "How, you might ask, can increased mortality be evidence of saved lives? The answer is Simpson's paradox.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the data and disenchant what the original article suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [This link](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbdca5329-b20b-4518-a733-fff84cc22124_1098x681.png) features the graph that was presented in the article. Use the dataset \"datasetfinalcorrected3.xlsx\" from the [U.K. Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsbyvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween2januaryand24september2021/datasetfinalcorrected3.xlsx) to replicate the graph, beginning on 19 March 2021!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. The journalist concludes: \"Vaccinated people under 60 are twice as likely to die as unvaccinated people. And overall deaths in Britain are running well above normal. I don't know how to explain this other than vaccine-caused mortality.\" Did you realize, when replicating his graph, what has paved the way for this wrongful conclusion?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. Now, use the whole available time range (1 January - 30 September 2021) and show the same graph for the other age groups as well!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4. So what explains the apparent reversal among people between 10 and 59 years old? Simpson's Paradox! And what are the particular causes of Simpson's Paradox within this age group?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "5. We will look at the data more carefully by following an analysis by epidemiologist Jeffrey Morris, who refuted the unreliable journalist's claims within days of their publication. He divides the excessively wide 10-59 year age group into 10 groups, each 5 years wide.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To estimate normal, pre-pandemic death rates in these groups, he uses 2019 data from the U.K. Office of National Statistics. To estimate the vaccination rate in each group, he uses data from the coronavirus dashboard provided by the U.K. Health Security Agency. Finally, to estimate the fraction of people in each age group, he uses data from a web site called PopulationPyramid, which organizes and publishes data from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Not to get lost in the details, these are all reliable data sources.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "We want to compute the distribution of ages in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups at the beginning of August 2021 (choosing a point near the middle of the interval in the original graph). Calculate the share of people per age group of the 10-59 year old, the share of vaccinated people per age group and the share of unvaccinated people per age group! Plot the share of vaccinated and unvaccinated along the age groups and comment!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "6. Now, for the sake of this example, let's imagine that there are no deaths due to COVID, and no deaths due to the vaccine. Based only on the distribution of ages and the death rates from 2019, compute the expected death rates for the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups!\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "7. So far we have used only data that was publicly available in November 2021, but if we take advantage of more recent data, we can get a clearer picture of what was happening then and what has happened since. In more recent reports, data from the U.K. Office of National Statistics are broken into smaller age groups. Instead of one group from ages 10 to 59, we have three groups from 18 to 39, 40 to 49, and 50 to 59. Use the dataset \"referencetable20220516accessiblecorrected.xlsx\" from the [U.K. Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsbyvaccinationstatusengland/deathsoccurringbetween1january2021and31march2022/referencetable20220516accessiblecorrected.xlsx) to show similar plots as in task 3!\n",

    "1. Describe the following 3 DAGs and their implications using e.g. \"confounder\", \"collider\", \"backdoor path\"!\n",

    "2. The following DAG combines the variables female ($F$), discrimination ($D$), occupation ($O$), ability ($A$) and earnings ($Y$). Explain the researcher's model expressed by this DAG!\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Imagine now, we were not interested in the total effect of discrimination on earnings but wanted to control for occupation. Google, for example, claimed that once occupation is taken into account, gender discrimination disappeares (https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/23164678/google-pay-118-million-settle-gender-discrimination-lawsuit). What problem would arise if we controlled for occupation?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The following code generates data as suggested by the DAG (hard coded & borrowed from Scott Cunningham). Use this data to show how the discrimination effect apparently changes if we a) only look at the total effect of discrimination, b) control for occupation and thereby open a backdoor path, and c) close this backdoor path while still controlling for $O$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In 2009 Megan Fox was voted the worst talented, but sexiest actress (https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BR3J020091228/?type=entertainmentNews). How are talent and beauty related? Are they? Look at the code below (borrowed from Scott Cunningham & Gabriel Rossman)! Here, talent and beauty are independent, random draws from a standard normal distribution, assigned to 2500 individuals. Consider individuals whose combination (sum) of talent and beauty ranks in the top 85th percentile as moviestars! Show only these moviestars in a scatterplot (talent vs beauty)! Make a judgement regarding the association of talent and beauty! How does the sample selection influence your perception?\n",
