# Local environment setup
Since we will put everything on our server, you will **not** need to do this. However, if you want to work on your local machine, you will need to do the following:

## How to use Git
Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code. It is a very powerful tool that is widely used in the industry. We will use it in this course to manage the code and the data.
'git' is a command line tool. You can use it in the terminal or in the command prompt. If you are not familiar with the command line, you can use a graphical user interface (GUI) for git. There are many GUIs available, but we recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

### Install Git
To install git, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://git-scm.com/).

### Clone the repository
To clone the repository, open the terminal or the command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository. Then run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firrm/DAI.git
```

## How to use Python 
We will use Python as the programming language for this course. Python is a very popular language for data analysis and machine learning. It has a large and active community, and there are many libraries available for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

### Install Python
To install Python, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

## How to use Poetry
We will use Poetry to manage the dependencies of the project. Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the dependencies of your project in a simple and declarative way, and it will automatically install the dependencies for you.

### Install Poetry
To install Poetry, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://python-poetry.org/).

### Install the dependencies
To install the dependencies of the project, run the following command in the terminal or the command prompt:

```bash
poetry install
```


## How to use Jupyter Notebooks
We will use Jupyter Notebooks to write the code. Jupyter Notebooks are a great tool for data analysis and visualization. They allow you to write and execute code, view the results, and add text and images. You can also export the notebooks to different formats, such as HTML, PDF, or slides.

### Install Jupyter Notebook
To install Jupyter Notebook, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://jupyter.org/).
