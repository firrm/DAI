    "Jupyter is an interactive development environment (IDE) in our browser for Python and other programming languages. All of Jupyter's functionality comes from another IDE called IPython, which we will not discuss further at this point. As you may have noticed, Jupyter is an abbreviation of **Ju**lia, **Py**thon, and **R**, as it provides support for a wide range of programming languages (over 40). Jupyter features big data integration (such as Apache Spark), interactive output (HTML, images, videos, and LaTeX), the ability to share notebooks with others (via email, Dropbox, GitHub, or the Jupyter Notebook Viewer), and the ability to choose your preferred programming language. More information can be found on the [jupyter homepage](https://jupyter.org).\n",

    "In our course, we teach theory and scientific computing using Python. The format of jupyter notebooks allows us to consolidate lecture notes, examples, and interactive tutorials into single documents that you can refer to while studying. The flexibility and richness of Jupyter is an important aspect of why we use it in our course. In the end, you have a one-stop shop for your learning."

    "Once you have created a new notebook, click on the `+` sign on the left of the shortcuts of the menu bar to generate a new building block. The newly created unit is ready to type Python code. If you want to write text instead of code in your building block, simply go to the shortcuts and select `Markdown` from the drop down menu. Markdown is a language that allows us to define html-like (Hypertext Markup Language) pages with minimal syntax, which makes it very convenient. To compile the written text (or code) just click `Run` and the notebook will execute the code and move on to the next building block. If you want to modify your block, double click on it, adjust it and recompile it."

Since the next sessions will include coding exercises, you should familiarize yourself with the commands you need to improve your efficiency. In addition to keyboard shortcuts, the `Help` menu contains references to all the scientific Python code libraries, such as Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib, which we will introduce and use in the next sessions."
